# PRODIGY_DS_01 – Task 1: Population Data Visualization

## 📌 Objective
The goal of this task is to analyze the global population dataset and create meaningful visualizations to understand:
- Population distribution across countries  
- Top populated countries  
- Long-term population growth trends  

The dataset used is the **World Bank Population Dataset**, containing population values for all countries from 1960 to 2024.

## 📊 Visualizations Created

### 1️⃣ Bar Chart – Top 20 Countries by Population (2023)
- Shows the top 20 most populated countries/regions.
- Helps identify global population leaders in 2023.

📁 File: `bar_chart_2023.png`

---

### 2️⃣ Histogram – Distribution of Country Populations (2024)
- Shows distribution and skewness of populations across all countries.
- Reveals that many countries have small populations while few have extremely large populations.

### 3️⃣ Bar Chart – Top 20 Countries by Population (2024)
- Updated comparison showing population changes from 2023 to 2024.
- Helps visualize slight shifts in rankings.

### 4️⃣ Line Chart – Population Trends (1960–2024)
- Displays population growth trends for selected countries (India, China, USA, Brazil, Germany).
- Clearly shows rapid growth in India & China.

## 📝 Conclusion
From the visualizations, we can conclude:
- A few countries dominate global population counts.
- Population distribution is highly skewed.
- India and China show the highest long-term growth trends.
- Countries like the USA and Brazil grow steadily, while Germany shows slow growth.

This task demonstrates how basic visualizations can reveal global demographic patterns using real-world data.
