# PRODIGY_DS_01 — Task 1: Data Visualization

## 📌 Objective
Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a continuous variable using a real dataset.

For this task, I used the **World Bank Population Dataset** to analyze and visualize population patterns across different countries.

---

## 📊 Task Description
### ✔ Created Visualizations:
1. **Bar Chart** – Top 20 most populated countries  
2. **Histogram** – Distribution of country populations in 2024  
3. Cleaned dataset and filtered required years

These visualizations help understand:
- How population is distributed globally  
- Which countries dominate the global population  
- Skewness and spread of the population distribution

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

---

## 📈 Summary of Insights
- Countries like **India, China, USA, Indonesia**, and **Pakistan** dominate global population rankings.
- The histogram shows a **right-skewed distribution**, meaning:
  - A few countries have extremely large populations.
  - Many countries have smaller populations.
- Data visualization makes it easier to compare and interpret population differences.

## 🚀 Conclusion
This task demonstrates how data visualization helps simplify complex datasets and extract meaningful insights using bar charts and histograms.
